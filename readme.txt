You can publish unlimited videos, there are no limit. 

= Will this plugin work/compatible with the theme I use? =

This plugin is compatible with most themes. But, unfortunately, we cannot check it with all third-party themes (especially paid ones) for compatibility, therefore there are cases when this plugin does not work with a third-party theme. We constantly check this plugin for compatibility with third-party themes. If we find that this plugin is incompatible with a third-party theme, and if we can fix it on our part, we release an update of our plugin to fix the problem.

If you find a conflict between our plugin and a third-party theme, please let us know and we will definitely release an update of our plugin to fix the problem.
